# Product Overview

PDF Downloader for Google Sheets - a Google Apps Script that automates batch downloading of PDFs from URLs listed in a spreadsheet. The script intelligently detects whether URLs are direct PDF links or wrapper pages with embedded PDFs, extracts PDF URLs when needed, downloads the files, saves them to a Google Shared Drive folder, and writes both the PDF URL and Drive link back to separate columns. Features automatic execution time management to handle large datasets that exceed Google Apps Script's 6-minute limit, with smart continuation triggers that resume processing automatically. Designed for teams that need to centralize PDF storage and maintain easy access through spreadsheet references.
